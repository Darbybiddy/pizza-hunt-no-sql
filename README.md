# pizza-hunt-no-sql

## OverView
In this module, you’ll build Pizza Hunt, a social media recipe app where users can post their creative spins on pizza, add comments to recipes, and create threads within comments. To do this, you’ll add back-end functionality to an existing front end.

Instead of using a MySQL database, you’ll use MongoDB, a document-based NoSQL database, and Mongoose, an Object-Document Mapper, to work with unstructured data.
